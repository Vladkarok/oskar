"""The control-socket integration suite — seam 1 of the two in the spec.

Every assertion in here crosses a real boundary: a protocol line goes into
the real helper over the real socket, and what comes back is either the
helper's reply, the compositor's opinion of the virtual keyboard, or the
helper's own log. Nothing mocks anything, which is why this needs a nested
Hyprland session and cannot join the host-runnable suites.

Adding a coverage: write another `@test` below. The order matters — the
tests share one helper process and each one starts where the last left off.
